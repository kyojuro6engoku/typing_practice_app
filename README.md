## Overview

The Typing Practice App is a simple command-line Python application designed to help users improve their typing skills. It presents random words for users to type and calculates their typing speed in words per minute (WPM) based on their accuracy and the time taken.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

2. Download the `typing_practice_app.py` file from this repository.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the `typing_practice_app.py` file.

4. Run the Python script using the following command:

   ```bash
   python typing_practice_app.py
   ```

5. The app will prompt you to press Enter to start typing a random word. Type the word presented and press Enter again.

6. After typing the word, the app will display whether you typed it correctly and your approximate WPM for the session.

7. To exit the practice, type 'exit' and press Enter.
